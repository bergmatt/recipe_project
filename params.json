I will be listing some of my favorite recipes from the days of yore. To begin with, I'll start off with a simple custard sauce from eighteenth century England, although you will find that there is not much difference with modern cusatard sauces today. The addition of rose water, which adds a nice floral note tot he sauce, is the main difference you might notice with modern sauces of this kind.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>4 egg yolks</li>\r\n        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>\r\n        <li>pinch of salt</li>\r\n        <li>1 3/4 cup milk</li>\r\n        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>\r\n        <li>4 drops rose water</li>\r\n        <li>1 1/2 tbsp brandy</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Method</h3>\r\n    <ol>\r\n        <li>In the top of a double boiler, beat the eggs yolks with the sugar and the salt.</li>\r\n        <li>Add the milk and the cream and stir well.</li>\r\n        <li>Set the pot over (not in) gently boiling water and cook, stirring constantly, until the custard is thick enough to coate the back of a spoon (about 10 minutes).</li>\r\n        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the rose water and brandy</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    \r\n    <p>Note: This sauce can be served hot or cold. It will thicken as it cools. </p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n",
